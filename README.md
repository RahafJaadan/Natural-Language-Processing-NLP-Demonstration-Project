# Natural-Language-Processing-NLP-Demonstration-Project 

## Objective 
This project is designed to provide a practical demonstration of basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, focusing on the following key operations:
1. **Tokenization**: Breaking down text into smaller units, such as words or sentences, for analysis.
2. **Stopword Removal**: Filtering out common words (e.g., “the,” “is,” “in”) to focus on more meaningful content.
3. **Stemming**: Reducing words to their base or root form using simple algorithms, such as converting “studies” and “studying” to “study.”
4. **Lemmatization**: Transforming words to their canonical form based on context, such as converting “went” to “go.”

## Usage 
This project serves as a guide to understanding the differences between stemming and lemmatization, the importance of stopword removal and tokenization, and how these preprocessing steps can enhance text analysis and understanding.

## Requirements 
* Python 
* NLP libraries such as NLTK and SpaCy
